# personal_website
This is my personal website built using ReactJS and Bulma as the CSS framework. 

The personal information on the website is populated from a json file that follows the JSON Resume open source standard.

# Contributing
Feel free to fork this project and customize with your personal info. If you implement any nice features or improvements I'd really appreciate if you could open a PR to this project ;)

# Customizing 
Feel free to fork this project and update it with your own information and style. Just update the ´src/resume.json´ with your personal information.

If you improve the app in any way a PR would be very apreciated ;)
